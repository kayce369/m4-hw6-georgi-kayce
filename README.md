## Issues

Initially, I had issues with the index.js file. For some reason, no matter what I did, it wouldn't even comprehend the basic alerts and structure that was in the document. I re-saved the original index.js file and it seemed to fix it, so not sure what happened there.

I also had the hardest time figuring out the Toppings section, but after tons of trial and error was able to figure it out.

Last, I ran into some confusion in the end about what to do when users press Cancel in the prompt questions instead of just leaving it blank, but was able to figure that out as well.
